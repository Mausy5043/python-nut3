This is an API overhaul of PyNUT_, a Python library to allow communication with NUT
(`Network UPS Tools`_) servers.

**Note**: This is an unofficial project, and is in no way supported or
endorsed by the `Network UPS Tools developers`_.

Requirements
------------

The module itself requires only Python (2.7 or 3.5+).
If you wish to run the tests, do ``pip install -r requirements-testing.txt``.

Usage
-----

Example::

    from nut2 import PyNUTClient
    client = PyNUTClient()
    client.help()
    client.list_ups()
    client.list_vars("My_UPS")

Please note that this module has completely and intentionally broken
backwards compatibility with PyNUT 1.X.

See inline documentation for more usage information.

Installation
------------

Just use pip::

    pip install nut2

PyNUT

The following information is copied from the original PyNUT README:

    This directory contains various NUT Client related Python scripts, written by
    David Goncalves, and released under GPL v3.

    * "module": this directory contains PyNUT.py, which is a Python abstraction
      class to access NUT server(s). You can use it in Python programs to access NUT's
      upsd data server in a simple way, without having to know the NUT protocol.

    To import it on Python programs you have to use the following (case sensitive) :
    'import PyNUT'

    This module provides a 'PyNUTClient' class that can be used to connect and get
    data from an upsd data server.

    To install the PyNUT module on Debian/Ubuntu, copy it to:
    /usr/share/python-support/python-pynut/

    This directory also contains test_nutclient.py, which is a PyNUT test program.
    For this to be fully functional, you will need to adapt the login, password and
    upsname to fit your configuration.
